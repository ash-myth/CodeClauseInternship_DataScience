## 🔍 Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset  
**Project ID:** #CC69855  
**Level:** Entry Level  
**Domain:** Data Science  

### 🎯 Aim  
Conduct exploratory data analysis on the famous Iris dataset to understand its characteristics and relationships between features.

### 📝 Description  
This project involves the use of Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to:
- Analyze the distribution of features like sepal/petal length and width
- Visualize inter-feature relationships
- Understand class-wise patterns (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

### 📚 What I Learned  
- Basic EDA techniques  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Data visualization best practices  
- Feature distribution and correlation analysis
